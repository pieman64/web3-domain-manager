## Gnosis Safe App
[Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) is a smart contract wallet running on Ethereum that requires a minimum number of people to approve a transaction before it can occur (M-of-N). If for example you have 3 main stakeholders in your business, you are able to set up the wallet to require approval from all 3 people before the transaction is sent. This assures that no single person could compromise the funds.

In order to use this dApp in Gnosis Safe you need to open Gnosis Safe and add UD NFTs Domain Manager.

Gnosis Safe has multiple environments:
 - Mainnet - https://gnosis-safe.io/app/
 - Rinkeby - https://rinkeby.gnosis-safe.io/app/
